                    This guide will outline strategies and important role-based responsibilities for each of the 4 bosses in Atal'Dazar, as well as some tips on particularly threatening trash mobs.
                    
                    When running this dungeon in Mythic+, additional affixes will be present on the enemies in the dungeon, affecting the way they behave.
                    </p><p>Loot drops at ilvl 310 on Normal mode for level 120 players, ilvl 325 on Heroic and ilvl 340 on Mythic.

                    For Mythic+ Dungeons, loot does not drop per boss. At the end of the dungeon, a special chest will spawn that contains loot from the dungeon, for which the base ilvl increases based on the Mythic Keystone level. The loot is personal, so each player should loot it to see what their reward is. Two pieces of loot are guaranteed and the items will be appropriate to the player's class/spec.
                    
                    In addition, all loot in Battle for Azeroth is on an ilvl spectrum. Most loot has a base ilvl and a progressively smaller chance to appear as a Warforged version, increasing in intervals of +5 ilvls. Learn more about loot in the BfA Gearing Guide.

At the end of the dungeon, a special chest will spawn that contains loot from the dungeon, for which the base ilvl increases based on the Mythic Keystone level. The loot is personal, so each player should loot it to see what their reward is. Two pieces of loot are guaranteed and the items will be appropriate to the player's class/spec.
                    
                    In addition, all loot in Battle for Azeroth is on an ilvl spectrum. Most loot has a base ilvl and a progressively smaller chance to appear as a Warforged version, increasing in intervals of +5 ilvls. Learn more about loot in the BfA Gearing Guide.
                    
                    Dungeon loot can also be found at random on World Quests, including quests that send you into the dungeon, as well as quests to kill random elites.</p>

                    For Mythic+ Dungeons, loot does not drop per boss. At the end of the dungeon, a special chest will spawn that contains loot from the dungeon, for which the base ilvl increases based on the Mythic Keystone level. The loot is personal, so each player should loot it to see what their reward is. Two pieces of loot are guaranteed and the items will be appropriate to the player's class/spec.
